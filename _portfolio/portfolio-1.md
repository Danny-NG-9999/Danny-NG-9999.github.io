This study examines how airport activity influences regional productivity across the UK (1998‚Äì2023), using a Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) framework and Granger causality tests to capture dynamic, bidirectional effects between passenger volumes, freight throughput, aircraft movements (ATMs), and GVA per head.

**1. ‚úàÔ∏è Passenger Activity**
- Passenger volumes Granger-cause productivity (Z = 23.143, p < 0.001), confirming airports‚Äô role as productivity driver.
- Short-term adjustment costs (‚Äì0.0335, p < 0.001): Increased passenger volumes initially reduce productivity (adjustment costs, congestion).
- Medium-term gains (+0.0183, p < 0.01): Positive effects emerge after 1‚Äì2 years as regions absorb connectivity benefits.
- Key Driver: Aircraft movements (ATMs) are more impactful than passenger volume alone.

**2. üì¶ Freight Activity**
- Freight volumes do not cause productivity (p = 0.6999); instead, productivity drives freight growth (Z = 3.382, p < 0.01) after roughly two years. This reflects the UK‚Äôs service-based economy, where freight responds to rising output rather than creating it, reinforcing that air cargo growth follows economic momentum.
- No direct productivity impact: Freight volumes do not Granger-cause productivity.
- Demand-driven: Freight expands in response to prior productivity growth (lag ‚âà 2 years).
- UK-specific context: Unlike manufacturing-heavy economies (e.g., U.S.), UK freight is a supporting actor, not a growth driver.

**3. üîÅ Bidirectional Relationships**
- Passenger ‚Üí Productivity: Yes (Granger-causal)
- Productivity ‚Üí Passenger: No
- Freight ‚Üí Productivity: No
- Productivity ‚Üí Freight: Yes (Granger-causal)

**4. üß≠ Policy Implications**
- Invest in flight frequency and network reliability over pure passenger capacity.
- View airports as connectivity enablers, not standalone growth engines.
- Align freight infrastructure with already productive regions‚Äîdon‚Äôt use it to stimulate growth.
- For major hubs, emphasize efficiency and sustainability; for emerging regions, enhance route diversity.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Data Considerations:**
- This study uses annual ITL1-level data, which may miss short-term fluctuations or local variations within regions. The productivity measure (GVA per head) includes all residents, not just workers, and air transport movements (ATMs) serve as a proxy for connectivity but don‚Äôt capture the diversity of routes. Future work could benefit from more detailed, employment-focused productivity data and finer-grained geographic analysisures.

In summary, Airports in the UK are connectivity catalysts‚Äînot automatic growth engines. Their economic value emerges when operational quality and network design align with regional industrial strengths, turning air mobility into sustained productivity gains.
