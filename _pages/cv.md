## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Transaction Advisory Analyst | Grant Thornton, Vietnam | November 2022 â€“ July 2024 

- **Financial Due Diligence:** Performed detailed reviews of trial balances, general ledgers, and supporting financial statements across 8 M&A transactions (Â£500kâ€“Â£8m), identifying and adjusting non-recurring items, misclassified expenses, unusual/suspicious and related-party transactions to establish normalized earnings and support accurate valuation models. Notably uncovered Â£500k EBITDA adjustment for an FMCG client, which strengthened the buyerâ€™s position in negotiations and drove a more favourable purchase price.
- **Risk and Contract Assessment:** Reviewed and analysed hundreds of customers, suppliers, loans, and leases agreements across multiple FDD engagements, identifying risks such as termination clauses, covenant breaches, take-or-pay commitments, and FX exposure. Notable findings included ~Â£500k of unrecorded liabilities in a Vietnamese manufacturing target (e.g., Â£180k take-or-pay penalty, Â£250k lease termination risk, Â£65k restoration obligation) and a $1m contingent liability from a cloud services auto-renewal clause. These findings resulted in a 5% enterprise value reduction, enabled buyers to secure SPA indemnities and renegotiated terms, and ensured critical risks were escalated and mitigated pre-deal.
- **Commercial and Revenue Analysis:** Conducted detailed revenue breakdowns by product and service line, mapped client contracts to expiry dates, and assessed sales concentration, growth trends, and margin variances. Identified a 15% revenue dependency on a single contract expiring within 9 months and flagged inflated related-party sales margins (20% above market) through benchmarking and comparative analysis. Reviewed shared services and management fee allocations, uncovering mischarges unrelated to actual services. These findings supported the buyer in negotiating a purchase price reduction and implementing post-acquisition cost-sharing protections, materially reducing acquisition risk.
- **Valuation and Reporting:** Contributed to DCF modelling and comparable company analyses by preparing supporting schedules (e.g., Operational Schedules and Capital Schedules), benchmarked target performance against sector peers; and synthesised results into exhibits, charts, and working papers presented to clients and partner
- **Client Engagement and Management:** Administered the Virtual Data Room (VDR) and Q&A process, coordinating with senior team members to deliver timely, accurate responses to client and counterparty queries; streamlined updates and communication workflows to ensure issues were resolved quickly and the due diligence process stayed on schedule.
- **Market Research:** Contributed the renewable energy sector section of the Doing Business in Vietnam 2024 guide, evaluating tariff regimes, project financing structures, M&A landscape, and regulatory risks. Findings were incorporated into the guideâ€™s insights, supporting investment feasibility assessments for international clients.

### Technology Consultant | KPMG, Vietnam | April 2021 â€“ June 2022

- **Risk Testing:** Conducted Tests of Design (ToD) and Tests of Controls (ToC) on IT systems covering access management, change management, and backup processes across multiple engagements. Identified control gaps and recommended remediation, providing reliable evidence of IT-dependent controls that allowed external financial auditors to place reliance on system-generated data and streamline audit procedures.
- **Data Integrity & Documentation:** Performed data integrity testing on key financial applications, including three-way match reconciliations using SQL and Excel, to validate the reliability of financial data and support timely completion of statutory audits. Updated and organised process documentation from prior engagements, creating a structured reference library in accordance with departmentâ€™s policy that improved knowledge sharing, staff onboarding, and departmental training.
- **Compliance and Control Testing:** Assessed privileged access rights and application security configurations during system reviews to ensure SOX compliance. Identified and facilitated the remediation of five high-priority access vulnerabilities, strengthening clientsâ€™ compliance posture and enhancing the overall control environment.
- **Project Management:** Contributed to a Â£3.4m data governance transformation programme, supporting KPMG Lighthouse experts and client teams in aligning data strategy with ISO 27001 and GDPR standards. Assisted with stakeholder communications by preparing presentations, Q&A logs, and progress reports, and processed project documentation for KPMG experts, helping ensure milestones were delivered on time, within budget, and in line with regulatory requirements.
