## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Transaction Advisory Analyst, Grant Thornton, Vietnam | November 2022 – July 2024

- **Financial Due Diligence:** Performed detailed reviews of trial balances, general ledgers, and supporting financial statements across 8 M&A transactions ($\pounds500\text{k}-\pounds8\text{m}$), identifying and adjusting non-recurring items, misclassified expenses, unusual/suspicious and related-party transactions to establish normalized earnings and support accurate valuation models. Notably uncovered $\pounds500\text{k}$ **EBITDA adjustment for an FMCG client**, which strengthened the buyer's position in negotiations and drove a more favourable purchase price.
- **Risk and Contract Assessment:** Reviewed and analysed hundreds of customers, suppliers, loans, and leases agreements across multiple **FDD engagements**, identifying risks such as termination clauses, covenant breaches, take-or-pay commitments, and FX exposure. Notable findings included $\sim\pounds500\text{k}$ of unrecorded liabilities in a Vietnamese manufacturing target (e.g., $\pounds180\text{k}$ take-or-pay penalty, $\pounds250\text{k}$ lease termination risk, $\pounds65\text{k}$ restoration obligation) and a $\$1\text{m}$ contingent liability from a cloud services auto-renewal clause. These findings resulted in a **$5\%$ enterprise value reduction**, enabled buyers to secure SPA indemnities and renegotiated terms, and ensured critical risks were escalated and mitigated pre-deal.
- **Commercial and Revenue Analysis:** Conducted detailed revenue breakdowns by product and service line, mapped client contracts to expiry dates, and assessed sales concentration, growth trends, and margin variances. Identified a $15\%$ revenue dependency on a single contract expiring within 9 months and flagged inflated **related-party sales margins** ($20\%$ above market) through benchmarking and comparative analysis. Reviewed shared services and management fee allocations, uncovering mischarges unrelated to actual services. These findings supported the buyer in negotiating a purchase price reduction and implementing post-acquisition cost-sharing protections, materially reducing acquisition risk.
- **Valuation and Reporting:** Contributed to **DCF modelling** and comparable company analyses by preparing supporting schedules (e.g., Operational Schedules and Capital Schedules), benchmarked target performance against sector peers, and synthesised results into exhibits, charts, and working papers presented to clients and partner.
- **Client Engagement and Management:** Administered the Virtual Data Room (VDR) and Q&A process, coordinating with senior team members to deliver timely, accurate responses to client and counterparty queries; streamlined updates and communication workflows to ensure issues were resolved quickly and the **due diligence process stayed on schedule**.
- **Market Research:** Contributed the **renewable energy sector** section of the Doing Business in Vietnam 2024 guide, evaluating tariff regimes, project financing structures, M\&A landscape, and regulatory risks. Findings were incorporated into the guide's insights, supporting investment feasibility assessments for international clients.
