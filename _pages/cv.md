## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Transaction Advisory Analyst| Grant Thornton, Vietnam | November 2022 – July 2024 

- Financial Due Diligence: Performed detailed reviews of trial balances, general ledgers, and supporting financial statements across 8 M&A transactions (£500k–£8m), identifying and adjusting non-recurring items, misclassified expenses, unusual/suspicious and related-party transactions to establish normalized earnings and support accurate valuation models. Notably uncovered £500k EBITDA adjustment for an FMCG client, which strengthened the buyer’s position in negotiations and drove a more favourable purchase price.
- Risk and Contract Assessment: Reviewed and analysed hundreds of customers, suppliers, loans, and leases agreements across multiple FDD engagements, identifying risks such as termination clauses, covenant breaches, take-or-pay commitments, and FX exposure. Notable findings included ~£500k of unrecorded liabilities in a Vietnamese manufacturing target (e.g., £180k take-or-pay penalty, £250k lease termination risk, £65k restoration obligation) and a $1m contingent liability from a cloud services auto-renewal clause. These findings resulted in a 5% enterprise value reduction, enabled buyers to secure SPA indemnities and renegotiated terms, and ensured critical risks were escalated and mitigated pre-deal.
- Commercial and Revenue Analysis: Conducted detailed revenue breakdowns by product and service line, mapped client contracts to expiry dates, and assessed sales concentration, growth trends, and margin variances. Identified a 15% revenue dependency on a single contract expiring within 9 months and flagged inflated related-party sales margins (20% above market) through benchmarking and comparative analysis. Reviewed shared services and management fee allocations, uncovering mischarges unrelated to actual services. These findings supported the buyer in negotiating a purchase price reduction and implementing post-acquisition cost-sharing protections, materially reducing acquisition risk.
- Valuation and Reporting: Contributed to DCF modelling and comparable company analyses by preparing supporting schedules (e.g., Operational Schedules and Capital Schedules), benchmarked target performance against sector peers; and synthesised results into exhibits, charts, and working papers presented to clients and partner
- Client Engagement and Management: Administered the Virtual Data Room (VDR) and Q&A process, coordinating with senior team members to deliver timely, accurate responses to client and counterparty queries; streamlined updates and communication workflows to ensure issues were resolved quickly and the due diligence process stayed on schedule.
- Market Research: Contributed the renewable energy sector section of the Doing Business in Vietnam 2024 guide, evaluating tariff regimes, project financing structures, M&A landscape, and regulatory risks. Findings were incorporated into the guide’s insights, supporting investment feasibility assessments for international clients.
