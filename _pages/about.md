## üöÄ About Me
I‚Äôm a professional with a background in finance and consulting, passionate about solving complex problems and transforming data into actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions. My experience includes uncovering significant EBITDA adjustments in M&A deals at Grant Thornton and supporting large-scale data governance transformation projects for clients at KPMG.

Curiosity and impact guide my work. I enjoy leveraging analysis and visualization to uncover hidden risks, identify growth opportunities, and clarify uncertainty, helping decision-makers turn complex data into clear, strategic action. What excites me most is discovering insights that reveal the real story behind the numbers and inform meaningful business decisions.

Beyond my professional work, I‚Äôm committed to sustainability, community, and continuous learning. I‚Äôve volunteered with Food Action Exeter, distributing meals to those in need, and contributed to sustainability consulting projects recognized for their positive social impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring caf√©s, attending local events, and spending time in green spaces. I thrive on uncovering insights that inspire action and enjoy connecting with others who share a passion for finance, analytics, and using data to create real-world impact.
