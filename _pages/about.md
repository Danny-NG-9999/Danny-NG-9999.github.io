## üöÄ About Me
I‚Äôm a London-based MSc Financial Economics graduate from the University of Exeter with a passion for transforming complex data into meaningful insights that drive smarter financial and strategic decisions. My career has taken me through the worlds of finance, analytics, and technology ‚Äî from uncovering ¬£500k EBITDA adjustments in M&A deals at Grant Thornton to supporting large-scale data governance transformation projects for clients at KPMG.

My journey into data has been driven by curiosity and a desire to understand what truly influences business performance. While working in finance and consulting, I saw firsthand how data can turn uncertainty into clarity ‚Äî whether by uncovering hidden risks, identifying untapped opportunities, or translating complex information into actionable insights. I was particularly drawn to how thoughtful analysis and visualization can cut through the noise to reveal the real story behind the numbers and data. These experiences reinforced my belief that strategic, data-driven insights are critical for mitigating risks and delivering meaningful business impact. 

This realization ultimately inspired me to pursue an MSc in Financial Economics ‚Äî a step that allowed me to strengthen my analytical foundation and allowed me to explore econometrics, data modeling, and predictive analysis in greater depth. The program helped me to bridge my financial background with a more data-driven mindset, equipping me with both the technical rigor and strategic perspective necessary to tackle complex business challenges.

During my master‚Äôs dissertation, I researched how airport connectivity influences regional productivity across the UK ‚Äî a project that showed how data can inform not only business strategy but also broader economic and policy decisions. Since then, I‚Äôve continued to build on that passion by exploring financial analytics, visualization, and data storytelling. Through projects on Kaggle and GitHub, I enjoy transforming raw datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter decisions and create measurable impact.

Beyond my professional work, I‚Äôm passionate about sustainability, community, and continuous learning. I‚Äôve volunteered with Food Action Exeter to distribute meals to those in need and contributed to sustainability consulting projects recognized for their positive social impact.

When I‚Äôm not working with data, you‚Äôll often find me exploring London‚Äôs caf√© scene, attending local events, or enjoying its parks and green spaces. I love that moment when data reveals something unexpected ‚Äî and I‚Äôm always keen to connect with others who share an interest in finance, analytics, and using data to make a real-world impact.
